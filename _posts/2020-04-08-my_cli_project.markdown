The CLI project so far has been one of the best and most challenging experiences.
This project for me was the kind of project that I was slow to start and would constantly pull my hair out in the beginning.in fact at first I scrapped my project about 6 times because I didn't like the direction I was going in..... aaahh those where the night I would stay up till 5 or in the morning only to wake up at 10am and stare at a cluttered screen. There was anger and frustration in the beginning not knowing how to even get off the ground. A few times I wanted to send my keyboard through my monitor lol. Good thing I didn't. but then one day as i'm sitting at my desk defeated and deflated something inside of me clicked a second wind some would say. I took a stepback and promised myself that this try would be the last try no more scrapping my work I would work through no matter what! I spent days trial and error difference method different Ideas of how I could get this program to work hr of videos watch, hours of online text read. until the pieces would come together.  This was the winning combination. Instead of looking at the project as a whole I had to look at each individual puzzle piece and figure that part out before moving on. My project lists out some must play video games up to this point in 2020 and gives descriptions on what the games are all about check out my repo and remember that inorder to succeed you need to look at the individual puzzle pieces insead of the messy scatter puzzle as a whole.
