 why did I choose Software Engineering? The short answer is because It is a very interesting set of skills that have loads of practical application why not learn Software Engineering. However, this explanation is vague and does not do my aspirations justice. I want to learn Software Engineering so I can start a business that leverages the Analytical and Database skills I learned in college with the software coding and website design skills learned with Flatiron, to provide top of the line customer service and technology products to individuals and small to large businesses. The combination of creativity given through software engineering and cold hard data given through statistical analysis and data mining, to create applications that will improve functionality for large sums of people really amps me up to learn as much as I can and actively improve myself so I can in the near future deploy these applications to customers.
