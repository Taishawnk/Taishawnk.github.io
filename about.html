<p>My story starts in 2010 at the age of 18, I had dropped out of high school and was homeless along with my older brother. Fast Forward to late 2011 I had gotten a job working at Mcdonalds. Where I met my future wife I moved in with her that same year and realized that the prospects I had job-wise would not lead to the lifestyle that I imagined for my wife, stepdaughter and myself. So I hastily got myself into an alternative school that allows individuals to obtain a high school diploma up until the age of 21. As I was going through the remaining highschool credits I needed I applied and planned to join the United States Army right after graduation. After meeting all of the requirements needed to graduate I finally graduated in May of 2012 only 2 months later in July I shipped out for basic training. Fast forward to 2016 after 4 1/2yrs of service I decided that It was time to move on. Although I did not have the clearest idea of what I wanted to do I did know that I needed to bolster my education. I decided at first that I was going to go to university for Business Management. I started my school journey going to a campus setting but after a few semesters realized that the act of physically going to university was wasting my time. So I switch to an online university where I change my major as well instead opting to go for Management of Information Systems and Analytics. Because of the flexibility gained by going to online school, I was also able to go to work as well after a little hunting I got a job as an IT Admin, for an engineering firm. After completing my degree in early 2019 I started to apply for multiple jobs over many months but began to realize that even with a bachelorâ€™s degree and a year and a half of experience no one was willing to give me a chance in the field of my degree. Bummed out and wondering how I could elevate myself I stumbled across Flatiron School. </p>
